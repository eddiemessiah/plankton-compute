# 🟦 INFINITE COMPUTING, ENDLESS SCALE. 🟦

## The Plankton Protocol

**Plankton** represents the convergence of high-performance distributed computing and privacy-preserving blockchain technology.

### 🚀 Infinite Compute
We aggregate decentralized processing power into a unified, elastic grid. This allows complex computations—from AI model training to scientific rendering—to be executed with the speed and reliability of centralized clouds, but without the single point of failure.

### 🛡️ Privacy-Preserving
Built on advanced zero-knowledge proofs and secure enclaves, Plankton ensures that data remains encrypted during computation. Validate the work, not the data. This unlocks a new era of secure, trustless applications where privacy is a guarantee, not a feature.
